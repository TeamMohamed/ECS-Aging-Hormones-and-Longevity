🧠 Overview

This repository contains the full white paper and supporting dataset for:

ECS & Aging, Hormones, and Longevity: A Systems Biology Framework for Age Reversal, Hormonal Regulation, and Epigenetic Optimization.”**

This paper redefines the endocannabinoid system (ECS) as a real-time operating system for managing aging, integrating:

- Cortisol & HPA Axis Recovery  
- Estrogen & Testosterone Feedback Loops  
- Circadian Recalibration via ECS–Melatonin Axis  
- Mitochondrial Immunometabolism & NAD+/SIRT1 Control  
- Telomere Preservation via Redox–CB2 Modulation  
- Epigenetic Reset: miRNAs, Histones, DNA Enzymes  
- Microbiome–Gut–Skin–Vagus–Quantum Circuitry  
- EAATs, Glutamate Handling & Biophotonic Field Repair  

Includes clinical stacks, ECS–miRNA maps, and the world’s **first ECS-vagus-microbiome-skin anti-aging serum**.
